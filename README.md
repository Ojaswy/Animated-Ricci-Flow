### ```Animated-Ricci-Flow```
Here, You can watch the animation of a curve turning into a singularity by ```Ricci Flow```.


```Ricci Flow``` is defined as the process of deforming the metric of a Reimannian Manifold in ways similar to the diffusion of heat.

Steps Involved: 

(i) Drawing a closed curve

(ii) Smoothing it
