# Animated-Ricci-Flow
Here, You can watch the animation of a curve turning into a singularity by Ricci Flow.


```Ricci Flow``` is defined as the process of deforming the metric of a Reimannian Manifold in ways similar to the diffusion of heat.

Steps Involved:

(i) Drawing/Giving the input of a closed curver

(ii) Smoothing it
